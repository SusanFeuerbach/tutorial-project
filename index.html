      <h1>How to Build a Scratching Post for Your Cat</h1>

      <h2>Why build your own cat scratching post?</h2>
      <p class="text">Scratching is beneficial both physically and emotionally.They need to scratch in order groom their claws. No, they are not "sharpening" their claws. Rather the action of scratching removes the dead layer that builds up on the claws. In addition
        the action of scratching provides good exercise for the paws, legs and entire body. It is important that the scratcher be tall enough to allow your cat to fully stretch his/her entire length. Cats also scratch for social reasons. Leaving signs
        of scratching is the cat's version of "tagging". Two things are happening, they are leaving their scents deposited by scent pads in the paws and the actual visual destruction that scratching leaves.</p>
      <p class="text">Most commercial scratching posts are not tall enough for the average cat, nor are they stable. One of the worst things that can happen is for a scratcher to fall over while the cat is using it. From the cat's viewpoint this is scary and he/she will
        not want to use the scratcher. For these reasons it would be best to make your own.</p>

      <h3>Prep the Parts:</h3>
      <p class="text">Cut post to appropriate height. For this project the post was cut 33" high.
      </p>
      <p class="text">Sand and finish the base as desired. For this project I stained it black using a water base stain and satin finish. You can also choose to paint the base. Be careful not to make the base too slippery.
      </p>
      <p class="text">You may also choose to finish the top platform. Or you can keep it wood if you plan to cover it.</p>
      <p class="text">Warp the sisal rope around the post. Glue the edges of the rope together to prevent unraveling. Staple the starting end to the post using 4-5 staples. Wrap the rope tightly around the post, stapling about every 7-10 rows. Be sure to apply the staples
        to the same side of the post.</p>
      <p class="text">Cut the molding into pieces about 2 1/4" long. Stain or paint to the match the base.</p>
